# Python Projects

Some projects and course exercises developed in python and jupyter notebook:
- **Courses**: Python Courses assignments and documentation:
1. *Applied Machine Learning in Python* from *Michigan University* through [Coursera](coursera.org).
2. *Introduction to Data Science in Python* from *Michigan Universitiy* through [Coursera](coursera.org).
3. *Data Science and Machine Learning with Python* from [Udemy](https://udemy.com) platform.
4. *Deep Learning Specialization* from [Coursera](https://es.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning): 
```
- Foundations of Deep Learning, build neural networks understanding, and learning how to lead successful 
  machine learning projects.
- Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization with case 
  studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural 
  language processing. 
- Technologies: Python and TensorFlow.
 ```
- **HypothesisTesting**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. In this project we run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. (`price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom`)
- **PredictingPropertyMaintenanceFines**: The goal of this project is to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.
