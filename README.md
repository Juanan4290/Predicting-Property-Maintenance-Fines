# Python Projects

Some projects and course exercises developed in python and jupyter notebook:
- **Courses**: Python Courses assignments and documentation:
1. *Applied Machine Learning in Python* from *Michigan University* through [Coursera](coursera.org).
2. *Introduction to Data Science in Python* from *Michigan Universitiy* through [Coursera](coursera.org).
3. *Data Science and Machine Learning with Python* from [Udemy](https://udemy.com) platform.
- **HypothesisTesting**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. In this project we run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. (`price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom`)
- **PredictingPropertyMaintenanceFines**: The goal of this project is to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.
